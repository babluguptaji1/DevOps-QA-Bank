‚úÖ Answer:
DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and deliver high-quality software reliably.

It emphasizes:

Collaboration between development and operations teams

Automation of processes like testing, integration, and deployment

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Monitoring and feedback loops for continuous improvement

By breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared responsibility, DevOps helps organizations respond faster to market changes and customer needs.

üîß Key Principles:
Collaboration: Developers and operations teams work together throughout the software lifecycle.

Automation: Tasks like testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring are automated to reduce errors and speed up delivery.

Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Code changes are integrated, tested, and deployed frequently.

Monitoring & Feedback: Systems are continuously monitored, and feedback is used to improve performance and reliability.


üöÄ Benefits:
Faster time to market

Improved software quality

Increased deployment frequency

Better alignment between business goals and IT
